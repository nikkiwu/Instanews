# INSTANEWS


Recreation of REDAcademy Project #2

Fetch API with AJAX and display articles in a pleasing fashion. Code must include responsive design, proper HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery.

Stretch goals: 

✓ Selectric (custom select)

✓ Animated header 

✓ Article appears on hover


## Useage

Instanews helps user select between popular categories and organizes in a user-friendly way. 

**behind the hood**

AJAX fetches API provided by NYTIMES, and with JQuery we are able to cycle through all popular/selected categories. In-order to display received API, we need to find the value of the object and concatenate them into one element.
